# organise_pics
I wrote this script because I wanted a really fast way to organise my photos.
I keep them on a web site, so I also wanted thumbnails and some medium sized images to keep the site fast.

The idea is to use the time that the photo was token to rename the file.
It also stores the file in a directory based on year and month.
It is easy to change this to be just by year.
It is also easy to turn off the resizing part and just copy the files.

I suggest using rsync to synchronise the directory structure with an offsite server for backups.
